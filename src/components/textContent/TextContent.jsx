        <h1>IT STARTED WITH A HANDSHAKE</h1>
        <p>
          It started with a handshake. Two visionaries, Bill Bowerman and his
          University of Oregon runner Phil Knight, thought they could do a
          better job of designing and selling shoes to runners. They were right.
          Today Nike is the world’s leading innovator in athletic footwear,
          apparel, equipment and accessories. Along the way, Nike helped the
          world’s best athletes win races, games and championships.

        <h1>WE LEAD WITH INNOVATIVE PRODUCT</h1>
        <p>
          True innovation isn’t just new and different. It’s new and better.
          It’s surprising. Sometimes it’s shocking. Nobody does that better than
          Nike. Yet we know you can’t anoint yourself as innovative the consumer
          ultimately decides that for themselves. That’s why we spend so much
          time with athletes and consumers listening, observing, studying and
          then creating products that enhance athletic performance and overall
          consumer experiences.
